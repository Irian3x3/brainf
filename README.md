# brainf

A brainfuck interpreter written in Rust ðŸ¦€.
Do not I wrote this in my spare time... but still its good!

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/codeaye/brainf
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd brainf
```

Install the cli globally with cargo

```bash

```

Or if you dont have make, just run
```bash
  cargo install --path . --profile release
```

Then put some brainfuck in a file (extension doesnt matter!)
Then run:

```bash
  brainf ./path/to/file.bf
```
